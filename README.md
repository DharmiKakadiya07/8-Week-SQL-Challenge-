# Danny`s 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the **8 Week SQL Challenge**, a SQL learning initiative created by Danny Ma as part of the *Data With Danny* virtual data apprenticeship program.

The challenge is designed to help learners develop practical SQL skills by working through real-world case studies that simulate common business problems. Each case study focuses on analysing structured datasets using SQL to extract meaningful insights.

## Repository Structure

Each case study is organised into its own folder and follows a consistent structure:

- `README.md` – Description of the case study and objectives  
- `schema.sql` – SQL scripts to create tables and insert sample data  
- `solutions.sql` – SQL queries used to answer the case study questions  with results set

This structure is intentionally designed to reflect real-world analytics workflows and to maintain a clean, recruiter-friendly Git history.

## Learning Objectives

Through this challenge, I aim to:

- Strengthen SQL fundamentals and advanced querying techniques  
- Practice data analysis using joins, aggregations, and window functions  
- Build a public SQL portfolio with well-documented case studies  
- Demonstrate incremental learning through meaningful Git commits
